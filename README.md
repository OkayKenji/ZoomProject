# ZoomProject
You know how on Zoom when another person has their camera off it just displays their name?

Well, this application tries to recreate this with one major difference. (other than the font and background is off - itâ€™s hard to find free fonts!) 

The major difference is that the name displayed bounces around. Just like the DVD logo bouncing around the screen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mGuCdlCcNM).
